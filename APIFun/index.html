    <h2> About This Page </h2>
    <p>
        The API I selected for this project is called SWAPI and is found on <a href="https://swapi.dev/">https://swapi.dev/</a>. 
        The API's purpose is to give users data about things in the Star Wars universe. 
        In this project, I used the API to get random Star Wars characters and display data about them on the page.
        To do this, I called a get request on 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/' + choice + '/', where choice was a randomly
        generated integer. This returned a JSON which had data about whichever character had the choice index.
        One website where I think this API might be useful would be some sort of Star Wars reference site where users
        could go to learn about Star Wars characters. Another way it could be used is in some sort of game
        where users are able to play as different Star Wars characters.
